<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Pulses constitute a cornerstone of the Indian diet, renowned for their rich protein content and nutritional benefits, frequently dubbed as the vegetarian’s protein powerhouse. Black gram not only provides nutritional benefits but also improves soil properties and fixes atmospheric nitrogen. If left unattended in storage, damage inflicted by three species of callosobruchus viz., C. chinensis, C. maculatus and C. analis on black gram seeds could result in substantial losses, both in quantity and quality.<br> In the context of insect resistance, a host genotype’s ability to resist insect pests is demonstrated through non-preference, antibiosis, or tolerance, and is closely linked to the morphological, physiological and biochemical traits of the germplasm.</br> </p>

<h2>Factors responsible for Bruchid resistance in Blackgram</h2>
<p><li><b>Seed size:</b> Small seeds are more resistant to bruchids than medium or large seeds.</li>
<li><b>Seed coat:</b> A thick texture layer on the seed can deter bruchids from ovipositing.</li>
<li><b>Morphological traits:</b> Other morphological traits that may be important for bruchid resistance include seed smoothness, pod hairiness, and seed shine.</li>
<li><b>Cultivar:</b> Some black gram varieties, such as TU 80 and TU 68, are resistant to bruchid beetles. The Trombay wild urd (Vigna mungo var. silvestris) is also resistant to bruchids.</li>
<li><b>Defense-related genes:</b> When bruchid beetles lay eggs in black gram pods, the pods activate defense-related genes, including defensin, PR, lipoxygenase, and signal transduction pathway genes.</li>
<h2>Materials and methods</h2>
<p>The current study was carried out at the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University's National Pulses Research Centre (NPRC), located in Vamban, Tamil Nadu, India, between 2019 and 2021. The region is situated at 10.36oN and 78.90oW in latitude. The MYMV disease incidence can be best evaluated in the field during the months of June and July at the NPRC, Vamban.The bioassay for the bruchid resistance and the molecular analysis were conducted at the Entomological laboratory and the Pulses Marker-Assisted breeding.</p>
<h2>Marker-assisted breeding for bruchid and MYMV disease resistance traits</h2>
<p>The present study used foreground markers flanking the QTL regions to select the positive plants in the F2 generation. Plants with homozygous B alleles for the identified QTL regions are forwarded to the next generation.</p>
<h2>Marker-assisted selection (MAS)</h2>
<p>Marker-assisted selection was used for the dual biotic resistance namely bruchid pest resistance and MYMV disease resistance in the cross MDU 1 x TU 68. The F1 generation generated from the cross MDU 1 x TU 68 were tested.</p>
